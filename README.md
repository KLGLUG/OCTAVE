# OCTAVE
### Why only Octave?
People who are using MATLAB should buy that but Octave is one of the major free alternatives to Matlab, others being FreeMat and Scilab.Scilab, however, puts less emphasis on (bidirectional) syntactic compatibility with Matlab than Octave does.
Since it is part of the GNU Project, it is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License.octave is free source(open )

### History of OCTAVE.....
The project was conceived around 1988. At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course. Real development was started by John W. Eaton in 1992. The first alpha release dates back to January 4, 1993 and on February 17, 1994 version 1.0 was released. Version 4.0.0 was released on May 29, 2015.

The program is named after Octave Levenspiel, a former professor of the principal author. Levenspiel is known for his ability to perform quick back-of-the-envelope calculations.

### Difference between OCTAVE and MATLAB?
Some of the differences that do exist between Octave and MATLAB can be worked around using "user preference variables." GNU Octave is mostly compatible with MATLAB. However, Octave's parser allows some (often very useful) syntax that MATLAB's does not, so programs written for Octave might not run in MATLAB
Matlab:
it's so expensive(MATLAB)and whereas OCTAVE is a open source , so that everybody can access it easily.

### HOW TO INSTALL OCTAVE?
